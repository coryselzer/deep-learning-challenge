# Deep-Learning-Challenge

## Project Overview
This is the Deep Learning Challenge.  In this project, we will use our knowledge of Python and deep learning to predict the successes of different organizations funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Project Goals

We will pull the data from the Charity Data CSV by reading it into a dataframe with Pandas.  From there, we will bin, cutoff and replace our data using the value count code as well as a For Loop.  From there, we will use TensorFlow and Keras sequential model to compile, fit and analyze our model for loss and accuracy.
